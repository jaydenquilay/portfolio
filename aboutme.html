    <h2>about me</h2>

        <img src="images/DSC00072.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="me!">
    
        <p>i'm <em>jayden quilay</em>, a student at bcit's new media and web development program.</p>
        <p>growing up, i always considered myself to be more into creative arts rather than into traditional academics.</p>
        <p>i am more fascinated by the art and design of things, which led me to pursue a career in photography.
        graphic design and ui/ux also fall into this category, as it was natural for me to get into.</p>
        <p>i haven't done much to showcase my skills, but eventually i'll be able to provide examples of my work
        in the near future.</p>
